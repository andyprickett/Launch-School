Look at several Rails/Ruby online API sources and say which one you like best and why.

Other than ruby-doc.org and api.rubyonrails.org, the guides.rubyonrails.org seem helpful. I will also be going through the Chris Pine book and the Codecademy courses. Hard to say which one I like best at this point.
